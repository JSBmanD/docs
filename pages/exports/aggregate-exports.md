## Overview

!!! info "For ex-TUNE Clients Only"
	This feature is currently only available for ex-TUNE clients and replicates the TUNE endpoints available via `https://api.mobileapptracking.com/v2/advertiser/stats/actuals/export`.

The Branch Aggregate Exports find and queue aggregate data that match your search criteria for export. Unlike the Custom Exports which contains individual logs for each attribution related to your mobile app, the Aggregate Exports include customizable visualizations of your data of interest.

Aggregate exports endpoints are limited to a maximum of 5k rows on the synchronous endpoint / 10k rows on the asynchronous endpoint and can query up to 180 days prior to the date of export. If more records are required, please make multiple requests with smaller time intervals to pull the necessary data in "batches".

## Authentication

Calls to the Aggregate Export API require an _api_key_ query string parameter to be passed with each request. API Keys are generated on a per-user basis and are permanent.

Learn how to [retrieve your API key (a.k.a. `Access Token`)](/dashboard/organization-view/#managing-your-user-profile)

!!! warning "Organization Level Access Required"
	In order to retrieve or reset your API Key/Access Token, you must have access to the Organization level of the account.  This functionality is not present at the app level.

##Rate Limits

Rate limits depend on the endpoint you are making a request to.

For creating and checking the status of exports, the rate limit is 2 requests per second, 10 requests per minute, and 1000 per hour.

## Export Access

In order to access Aggregate Exports, a user will need to have both **Aggregate Data** and **Export** access.

For more details on how to give a user the required access, please follow [Granting a User Export Access](/dashboard/export-access/#granting-a-user-export-access).

### Third Party Access

Any user with access to an account’s API keys will be able to access Branch’s Custom Export API (and thus unfiltered, log-level data). As a result, we would recommend against providing third parties with the permissions required to view API keys during the invitation process.


### Providing Agencies/Partners API Access

If you work with an agency that runs your advertising campaigns and want to give them access to export the subsequent data, you can provide them with access to the Custom Export API.

To provide an agency team member with access to the Custom Export API:

1. In the left-hand navigation, under **Setup & Testing**, click on **Account Settings**.
2. On the **Account Settings** page, click on the **Agencies** tab.
3. Expand the agency in question, find the agency team member you want to give access to, hover on the button in the **Actions** column and click **Edit**.
4. In the **Edit Agency Team Member** modal:
    1. Under **Access Level**, check the **Export** box.
    2. Under **Permissions**, check the **Aggregate Data** box.
5. Optional: add data filters
    1. Under **Data Filters**, toggle any necessary data filters on/blue. Exported data will be filtered accordingly.
6. Click **Save**.

!!! warning "Agency-Tagged Data"
	If you do not enable the Only Show Agency-Tagged Data data filter, the Agency Team Member will be able to export aggregate data associated with all of your campaigns, regardless if they are associated with them or not.


## Available Topics to Export

The following log topics are available via the Aggregate Export API:

*   **Clicks**
*   **Events**
*   **Impressions**
*   **Installs**
*   **Opens**
*   **Revenue USD**

!!! info "Info"
	Branch does not support exports of the infrequently-used update and postbacks TUNE topics.

	!!! warning "IP Discrepancies"
		Geographic data, such as country and city, may not be available for a very small percentage of events where the IP cannot be resolved to a location.

!!! warning "Discontinued Fields"
	Some fields have very limited value to our customers and as such have been discontinued. Discontinued fields will not be available via the Custom Export API. Please work with your CSM or our Support team if you have questions or concerns.

### Including Fields from Related Data Objects

Related objects no longer use periods ( . ) to access the properties on the object. Rather, field names use underscores ( _ ) only.

For example, `site_event.id` will now be exported as `site_event_id`.
