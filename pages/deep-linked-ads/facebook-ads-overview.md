Branch links can be used together with **[Facebook](http://facebook.com/)**  ads, allowing you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app. Refer to [Facebook's Ad Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide){:target="\_blank"} to learn more.

Facebook's Ad Platform supports numerous campaign types and a shared set of advertisement formats. To help you navigate Facebook's Advertisement Platform we created this guide detailing how to use Branch links in all major Facebook ad types.

Currently Facebook appears to only support sending one fb_content_id (etc) per event, whereas Branch allows you to send many. To provide as much functionality as possible, we choose the first content_item and search it for key-value pairs that can be sent to Facebook.

## Sharing Facebook Data

There are many ways to access data pertaining to Facebook.

You can see analytics on impressions, clicks, installs, opens and conversion events on various pages of the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io){:target="\_blank"}, as well as the [Query API](/exports/query-api).

### Facebook's Advanced Mobile Measurement Agreement

If you have signed Facebook's ["Advanced Mobile Measurement" agreement ("Data Use Terms for Advanced Mobile App Measurement")](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/advanced_mobile_measurement/tos), then you can get device level data out via:

- [Webhooks](/exports/ua-webhooks/)
- [Daily Export API](/exports/api-v3/)
- [CSV Exports](https://dashboard.branch.io/data-import-export/csv-exports)

!!! warning " Agreement not Signed"
	If you have not signed this agreement, any event attributed to a Facebook ad will look like an organic event when accessed via Webhooks, the Daily Export API, and CSV Exports.

### Data Limitations

- [x] We cannot send device-level Facebook attribution data to third parties.
- [x] We cannot send events attributed to Facebook via Data Integrations. Please instead consider analyzing this data in-house (using Webhooks, the Daily Export API, or CSV Exports), or using the Branch Dashboard for all of your analytics and attribution needs.
- [x] This data is also not returned in the deeplink initSession callback within the app. If you have analytics needs that are not met by the Branch Dashboard, please [contact us](https://support.branch.io/support/tickets/new) and include "Facebook MMP + Feature Request" in the subject.
