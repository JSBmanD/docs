## Overview

Branch links can be used together with Google Marketing Platform app conversion ads, allowing you to track ad-driven app conversion (installs and in-app events) on the Branch dashboard.

!!! info "Google Whitelisting Required"
	You must request whitelisting from your Google rep for the new 'App Analytics' section of Floodlight Configuration in order to generate link ID's for this integration.

The [Google Marketing Platform](https://support.google.com/dcm/answer/9015629?hl=en) includes the following products:

- Display & Video 360 (Formerly DoubleClick Bid Manager)
- Campaign Manager (Formerly DoubleClick Campaign Manager)
- Search Ads 360 (formerly DoubleClick Search)

## Legacy Doubleclick Integration

If you have not been whitelisted to use the new Google Marketing Platform, you can still use the Legacy Doubleclick integration to track your Doubleclick campaigns.

DoubleClick supports tracking links, and is also a self-attributing network with limited data in the response. Follow the relevant setup guide for the behavior you would like to see. Where possible, we recommend setting up *both* implementations for complete coverage, so data appears in Branch, the ad partner, and DoubleClick.
