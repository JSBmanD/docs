## Forwarding Events to Google Ads

Once you begin tracking events through the Branch SDK, you can select which events to import in Google Ads. Google Ads has pre-defined events that map to pre-defined Branch events, listed below. Reference this [doc](https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking/api/) for more information.

Regardless of campaign type, Branch will forward in-app events to Google Ads for campaign optimization. In addition, Branch will receive attribution data for rich analysis in the Branch dashboard.

## General FAQs

### What is Parallel Tracking?

!!! warning "Since October 30, 2018, parallel tracking is required for all Google Ads accounts."

In the past, Google Ads' non-UAC campaign clicks were tracked through “sequential tracking” (i.e. a client-side redirect). When an ad was clicked, the customer’s browser would go to the tracking URL, and then the tracking URL was responsible for forwarding the browser on to the Final URL.

![image](/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/google/legacy-sequential-tracking.png)

With the change to “parallel tracking”, Google sends the customer directly to the Final URL, and uses the new Beacon API to "click" the Tracking URL (including following any server side redirects) in the background. The key here is that the Tracking URL (and redirects) are still being visited by the end user's browser, but because this happens “in parallel” (i.e., not visible to the customer), the user experience is better. For browsers without Beacon API support, Google will fall back to legacy sequential tracking.

![image](/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/google/new-parallel-tracking.png)

#### How Does Parallel Tracking Work?

If you are running a Universal App Install Campaign, parallel tracking does not come into play as this campaign type directs users solely to the respective app store and does not include a third party link.

If you are running a non-UAC Web-based Ad (Display, Search, Shopping, Video), and using a Branch link as either the `Final URL` or `Tracking Template`, parallel tracking ensures your users are directly routed to the final destination while also allowing Branch to properly measure and attribute the resulting actions/conversions.

![image](/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/google/google-ads-non-uac.png)

#### How Does This Impact Me?

Attribution is unaffected because, although the Branch link is no longer the referring URL to the domain, parallel tracking still allows Branch link clicks to happen. This means the Branch Match ID parameter is still appended to the link that is being "clicked", and Branch can still store (and access) the Match ID in local storage because the web SDK can still load and read query parameters, even in the background.

Furthermore, this is in line with Google & Safari’s expectations of how clicks should be tracked (i.e., using query parameters instead of third-party cookies), and is compliant with current policy.

### Why is my ad being disapproved on Google Ads?

**A:** For Video Campaigns, sometimes your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to Google Play or App Store when clicked on a desktop. Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.

For Cross Platform campaigns, sometimes your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to your Final destination URL specified in the ad. Please ensure that your Branch link redirects to your Final URL specified in your ad. To ensure install tracking is functional please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and your Branch link's iOS/Android redirects are set to their respective App / Play Store.
