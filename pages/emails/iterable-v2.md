### Configure Iterable account to support iOS Universal Links

1. Determine which links you want to redirect to your iOS application.

2. Once you have determined which URLs to link to, create an Apple-App-Site-Association (AASA) file that contains the redirect rules to the URLs you have identified. This file is a JSON object that determines which links to rewrite into Universal Links. Here's a sample that you can use.
```
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "appID.bundleID",
                "paths": [
                    "/a/*"
                ]
            },
            {
                "appID": "iterable",
                "paths": [
                    "PATHS TO BE REDIRECTED GO HERE"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

3. Iterable will use your AASA file to determine which links in your messages to rewrite into iOS Universal Links.

!!! info "Important Note"
	After the links have been rewritten by Iterable, they will appear in this format:

	- Normal track and redirect URLs: mydomain.com/u/samplepath

	- iOS Universal Links: mydomain.com/a/samplepath

4. Email your AASA file to [Iterable Support](mailto:support@iterable.com).

5. After Iterable processes the file, you can view it on the bottom of the project settings screen (**Settings > Project Settings**).
