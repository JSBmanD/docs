**Important Note:**

To get the Analytics for Journeys, you need to have Journeys enabled and set up on the dashboard as per the documentation [here](/web/journeys/).


## Step by Step Process

1. In your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/), click on "_Web to App_" and then select "_Journey Banners_" in the navigation bar.

2. Once the web page loads you'll be landed on the Analytics page for all your Journey campaigns.


## Top Menu

At the top of the page, you'll see a menu of options that apply to both the graph and table views. Here, you can set the date range you'd like to see data for. This date range will apply to both the graph and table views on the page. You won't be able to see data from prior to October 14th, 2017, as that is the date Branch switched to our updated attribution model and data pipeline.

Additionally, you can share your current dashboard view using the share button, preserving filters and time windows. This is useful for circulating a specific set of filters among your team or with your Branch Technical Account Manager.

## Graph View

Here you can see a visual breakdown of where your various in-app and web events are originating from the Journey banner. These events can be further filtered by the various analytics tags from their originating ad campaigns.

## Common Analytics Labels

1.  CAMPAIGN: Auto-populated by the name of the Journey.
1.  TAGS: Auto-populated by the name of the Journey view.
1.  MOBILE PAGEVIEWS:This is the total amount of the pageview's your website has received for the date range.
1.  JOURNEYS VIEWS:The total number of times the Journey banners were loaded and displayed on the webpage.
1.  REACH: This the percentage of the web pages that are loading the Journeys banner on your website. The higher the number, the maximum installs you'll be driving.
1.  VIEW TO CLICK: The ratio of the total number of times the banner was loaded and viewed on the webpage to the total number of times the users actually clicked on the banner.
1.  VIEW TO OPEN:The ratio of the number of Journeys banner was loaded and viewed on the webpage to the number of open events triggered in the app. This will include both the open events when the user clicks the banner or does an open event manually after seeing the banner on the web.

**To get the performance of the banner, you can scroll down to the table below the graph:**

## Table View

The Table View lets you see a more granular view of your event data. Here you can filter and compare fields with the same parameters as in the graph view, and see a side by side view of your events. Use the three vertical column button to select which events you'd like to see in this table.

The Unique checkbox on both the graph and table views allows you to restrict reports to one event of each type per user. For example, take a user who clicked an ad link, then opened the app 7 times within the attribution window for that link. With the Unique box checked, we'd report one of those opens, with it unchecked, we'd report all 7.
