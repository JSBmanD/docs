    What does this mean???

    - **Existing Users** can continue to leverage the SDK integration to import events tracked by Segment into their Branch account.

    - **New Users** please use our server-side data integration with Segment to either [import Segment data into Branch](/integrations/segment-import/) or [export Branch Data into Segment](/integrations/segment-export/).
