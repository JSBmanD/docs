!!! warning "DO NOT USE OUTSIDE CHINA"
	This guide is specific to China and cannot used for the attribution of Android devices outside of China.  

## Overview

The mobile app market in China is unique in that there are hundreds of app stores with Google being a minor one. This dictates the necessity for a unique approach to supporting attribution for apps downloaded in China.

As attribution providers mainly rely on Google's advertising identifier (GAID) for attribution - which is not available via any other app store in China - a different device identifier must be used to accurately attribute installs in the Chinese mobile app market.

To this end, Branch built an Android plugin specifically to capture the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) of any Android device.
