	Within a customer account, an Agency does not have access to change their own permissions, access billing or SSO.

The "Agency" view of a Branch account is another additional level of entity access and is intended for Branch accounts that work with agencies - both full AORs and limited - that buy media on their behalf. Agency view allows the Agency to manage its own team within the Branch dashboard. Agency team members can switch between the Agency view and the App view at any time.

**The Agency view is for managing account-level functionality; e.g. managing agency team members and access.  Toggle to the [App view](app-view.md) to access the majority of your day-to-day needs for creating links and viewing reporting.**

### Default Agency Restrictions

Due to the nature of allowing third parties access to your data -  as well as what data you don't want them to access - when an Agency team member is in App view, they will not be able to access certain aspects of the Branch account regardless of the access levels applied to the user.

- Agency users cannot add/remove team members to/from their customers’ dashboards.
- Agency users are not allowed to reset app keys or delete apps.
- Agency users are not allowed to add/remove agency access.
- Agency users are allowed to create apps in the Organization view, but not stand-alone apps in the App view.
	- This means agencies don’t actually “own” apps; rather they’ll just be able to manage the apps of others.
- Agency users do not have access to the Billing and SSO sections of their customers’ dashboards.

!!! info "Disabled Functionality"
	Any restricted functionality - either due to default Agency restrictions or selected access levels - in the Branch dashboard will be (1) grayed out, (2) not clickable, (3) include a pop up modal informing the user about restricted access.
