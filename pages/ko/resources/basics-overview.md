Your customer journeys are fragmented across channels and platforms, but traditional attribution systems are unable to connect the dots because they see each fragment as a different, anonymous user.

People-Based Attribution stitches all of these identity fragments back together. The result: a single, deduplicated persona for each of your actual human customers, available to reference across every channel and platform for accurate measurement and personalized user experiences.
