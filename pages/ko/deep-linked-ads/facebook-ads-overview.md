Branch links can be used together with **[Facebook](http://facebook.com/)**  ads, allowing you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app. Refer to [Facebook's Ad Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide){:target="\_blank"} to learn more.

Facebook's Ad Platform supports numerous campaign types and a shared set of advertisement formats. To help you navigate Facebook's Advertisement Platform we created this guide detailing how to use Branch links in all major Facebook ad types.

This documentation supports the following Facebook Ad Campaigns:

We also have a document with [FAQs and Advanced Options](/deep-linked-ads/facebook-ads-faq/) for Facebook Ads. We recommend starting with one of the guides above, then jumping into the FAQ and Advanced Options when you have questions or need to troubleshoot.
