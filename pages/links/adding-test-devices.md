Before you start [Testing your Universal Ads Campaign setup](/resources/testing-universal-ads-campaign-setup/),we recommend you first setup a test profile for your test mobile device. By adding your device as a test device, you can repeatedly test for proper functionality with the same device.

!!! info "Test Devices"
	If you do not setup your device as a test device in your Branch account, you will only be able to test once as Branch only allows one install per unique device. In addition, repeated install attempts will be marked as `reinstalls` and possibly as fraudulent if you've enabled any fraud rules.
