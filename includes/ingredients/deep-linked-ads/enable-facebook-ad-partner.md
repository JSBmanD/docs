#### Enable Facebook as an Ad Partner (for measurement)

!!! Note
    Completing this section -- "Enable Facebook as an Ad Partner" -- will result in Branch sending app events to Facebook in order to attribute them back to ad campaigns. <notranslate>**This does not enable deep linking for the ad**</notranslate>. Further work below is required for deep linking.

If you haven't enabled Facebook as an Ad Partner on the Branch dashboard follow this section to do so. Advanced options for sending events can be found [here](/deep-linked-ads/facebook-ads-faq/#facebook-mmp-event-options).

1. Navigate to the [Partner Management tab](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management).

1. Search for <notranslate>**Facebook**</notranslate>.

1. Click `Connect With Facebook`

1. Confirm that Branch can have permissions `ads_read`
