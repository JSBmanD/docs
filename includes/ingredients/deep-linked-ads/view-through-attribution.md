### View-Through Attribution (VTA) with Impression Pixels

View-through attribution allows you to track installs, session starts and conversion events back to an ad impression, even if the ad was never clicked on.

Our view-through attribution logic is currently as follows for any given event:

- If there's a click within a valid attribution window, give credit to the click.
- If there's no click within a valid attribution window, give credit to the last impression that was within a valid attribution window.

Currently, view through attribution is supported for Self Attributing Networks (SANs), such as Facebook and Google, and non-SAN networks with server to server impression link support. To create a impression tracking link for non-SAN networks, simply [create an ad link](#create-an-ad-link), and grab the impression link from the final step of link creation. SAN networks support VTA without any additional links.
