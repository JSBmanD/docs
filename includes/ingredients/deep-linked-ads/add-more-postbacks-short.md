#### Adding/Enabling More Postbacks

Basic postbacks are automatically activated for events like _Install_ and _Purchase_ when you enable your ad partner. You can then add additional postbacks, for example, if you wanted to add postbacks for custom events that are specific to your app like _Account Created_.

To add a postback:

1. Under **Partner Management**, select the partner for whom you want to add/edit their postback.
2. Click on the **Postback Config** tab on said partnerâ€™s page.
3. Click the **Add New Postback** button at the bottom of the screen.
4. A modal will appear with Branch default events, as well as any commerce (reserved events like _PURCHASE)_ or custom events you've set up. Select an event, enter a postback URL if you're asked to, and click **Save**. This will be the event that triggers your new postback.
    1. NOTE: If Branch does not already have a postback template for a partner, please provide a valid URL for your partner.
