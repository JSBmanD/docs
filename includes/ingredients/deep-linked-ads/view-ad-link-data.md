### Viewing Your Data

The Ads Analytics Page on the Branch dashboard provides an interactive time series graph and table to view the performance of your Ad campaigns:

- Easily interact with your Analytics data breakdown and compare aspects of your Ad campaigns' performance by using the <notranslate>**Compare by**</notranslate> button to add a parameter to split the data displayed data by.
- You can also use the <notranslate>**Add Filter +**</notranslate> button to refine the data displayed to gain deeper insight into the performance of your Ad campaigns.

The <notranslate>**TRENDS**</notranslate> table shows the chart and breakdown of last 7 days data on the campaign performance by ad partner.

The <notranslate>**EVENTS**</notranslate> table shows summary data on the performance of each Ad campaign.

On the top right side of the table you can find a download button to retrieve the chart's content as a CSV file.  For more info about Ads Analytics refer [here](/activity-reports-analytics/paid-ads-analytics/).
