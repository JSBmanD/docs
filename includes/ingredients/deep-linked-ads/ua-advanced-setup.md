### Change attribution windows

Attribution windows can be specified at the global account level or on a per link basis with the link level window taking priority. See the below instructions for setup.

For customer experience and data accuracy, please do not set your deep linking window longer than the other attribution windows.

#### Account Level Attribution Windows

You can edit your attribution windows under Link Settings > Attribution Windows.

Learn more about account level attribution windows in [People-Based Attribution](/dashboard/people-based-attribution/#attribution-windows).

#### Ad Network Attribution Windows

You can edit your attribution windows at the ad network level, if your ad network requires it. This is recommended when you enable networks like Facebook and Google, who may have different windows for installs. With this, you can preserve your Account Level Attribution Windows, as well.
