### Add more postbacks

When you enable an ad partner, your ad partner postbacks can be found under the <notranslate>**Postbacks**</notranslate> tab for that ad partner. It's easy to add additional postbacks.

1. Click the <notranslate>**Add New Postback**</notranslate> button at the bottom of the screen.

1. A modal will appear with Branch default events, as well as any commerce or custom events you've set up. Select an event, enter a postback URL if you're asked to, and click <notranslate>**Save**</notranslate>. This will be the event that triggers your new postback.
